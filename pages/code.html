            I am a deep believer of Software Craftsmanship and clean code.
            I believe code should work well, add value, be flexible and testable.
            It should not be rigid, fragile or cluttered, it should be clean!
            That through interacting, communicating, and collaborating we have all the essential tools at our disposal 
            to succeed. I believe that the best way for us to manage rapid change and do so productively,
            is by constantly monitoring the state of the code base. 
            To me, itâ€™s all about responsibility, professionalism and ethics.
