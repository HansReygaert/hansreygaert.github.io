            Whether it is getting lost in another world or picking up a new skill,
            a good book is a medium unlike any other. I'm slowly making more time 
            to read the books that have long been sitting on my shelf, including some of 
            these gorgeous clothbound penguin classics. You'll find me reading a non-fiction book
            more often than one of fiction, but I find both to have their time and place.

            Whenever I read, my objective is to learn something I did not before. 
            Since I'm a naturally very curious person and I don't mind it at all to read papers that 
            are highly abstract or complex, I often find myself nose deep in subjects most people 
            wouldn't concern themselves with. Obviously my aim today is more focused and I 
            mainly concern myself with books that involve software design and architecture. 
            <i>"Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans"</i> is sitting very highly on my reading list
            and is the next one I'll find myself nose deep in.

            Two notable non-fiction books I recently read are 
            <i>"Never split the difference by Chriss Voss"</i> and 
            <i>"Moonwalking with Einstein"</i>. Both are excellent non-fiction books 
            the foremost concerning itself with negotiations of any kind and 
            the latter with memory recall techniques. I can only highly recommend them.   

            Right now, I'm reading the 
            Russian literary masterpiece <i>"Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky"</i>
