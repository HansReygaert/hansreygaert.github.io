            Usually when I'm taking a small break from coding, I will start a Rocket League game.
            I like the mechanics of the game, it's fun, fast and team oriented. 
            But honestly, I'm not very good at it. I don't have the time or interest 
            to invest a large amount of effort in reaching yet another division. I'd rather
